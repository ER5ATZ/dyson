        </h1>
        <p>
          A Dyson sphere is a hypothetical megastructure that encompasses a star and captures a large percentage of its
          solar power output.[1][2][3] The concept is a thought experiment that attempts to imagine how a spacefaring
          civilization would meet its energy requirements once those requirements exceed what can be generated from the
          home planet's resources alone. Because only a tiny fraction of a star's energy emissions reaches the surface
          of any orbiting planet, building structures encircling a star would enable a civilization to harvest far more
          energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first modern imagining of such a structure was by Olaf Stapledon in his science fiction novel Star Maker
          (1937). The concept was later explored by the physicist Freeman Dyson in his 1960 paper "Search for Artificial
          Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation". Dyson speculated that such structures would be the logical consequence
          of the escalating energy needs of a technological civilization and would be a necessity for its long-term
          survival. A signature of such spheres detected in astronomical searches could be an indicator of
          extraterrestrial life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since Dyson's paper, many variant designs involving an artificial structure or series of structures to
          encompass a star have been proposed in exploratory engineering or described in science fiction, often under
          the name "Dyson sphere". Fictional depictions often describe a solid shell of matter enclosing a star – an
          arrangement considered by Dyson himself to be impossible.

        <h2>
          Origins
        </h2>
        <p>
          Inspired by the 1937 science fiction novel Star Maker by Olaf Stapledon,[4] the physicist and mathematician
          Freeman Dyson was the first to formalize the concept of what became known as the "Dyson sphere" in his 1960
          Science paper "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation". Dyson theorized that as the
          energy requirements of an advanced technological civilization increased, there would come a time when it
          would need to systematically harvest the energy from its local star on a large scale. He speculated that this
          could be done via a system of structures orbiting the star, designed to intercept and collect its energy. He
          argued that as the structure would result in the large-scale conversion of starlight into far-infrared
          radiation, an earth-based search for sources of infrared radiation could identify stars supporting intelligent
          life.[5]
        </p>
        <p>
          Dyson did not detail how such a system could be constructed, simply referring to it in the paper as a 'shell'
          or 'biosphere'. He later clarified that he did not have in mind a solid structure, saying "A solid shell or
          ring surrounding a star is mechanically impossible. The form of 'biosphere' which I envisaged consists of a
          loose collection or swarm of objects traveling on independent orbits around the star".[6] Such a concept has
          often been referred to as a Dyson swarm,[7] though in 2013 Dyson said that he had come to regret that the
          concept had been named after him.[8]

          Search for megastructures
        </h2>
        <p>
          Dyson-style energy collectors around a distant star would absorb and re-radiate energy from the star. The
          wavelengths of such re-radiated energy may be atypical for the star's spectral type, due to the presence of
          eavy elements not naturally occurring within the star. If the percentage of such atypical wavelengths were to
          be significant, an alien megastructure could be detected at interstellar distances.[5] This could indicate
          the presence of what has been called a Type II Kardashev civilization.[9]
        </p>
        <p>
          SETI has looked for such infrared-heavy spectra from solar analogs, as has Fermilab.[10][11] Fermilab
          discovered 17 potential "ambiguous" candidates, of which four were in 2006 called "amusing but still
          questionable".[10] Later searches also resulted in several candidates, all of which remain
          unconfirmed.[12][13][14]
        </p>
        <p>
          On 14 October 2015, Planet Hunters' citizen scientists discovered unusual light fluctuations of the star KIC
          8462852 raising press speculation that a Dyson sphere may have been discovered.[15][16] However, subsequent
          analysis showed that the results were consistent with the presence of dust.[17][18]

          Feasibility and science-based speculation
        </h2>
        <p>
          Although Dyson sphere systems are theoretically possible, building a stable megastructure around the Sun is
          currently far beyond humanity's engineering capacity. The number of craft required to obtain, transmit, and
          maintain a complete Dyson sphere exceeds present-day industrial capabilities. George Dvorsky has advocated
          the use of self-replicating robots to overcome this limitation in the relatively near term.[19] Some have
          suggested that Dyson sphere habitats could be built around white dwarfs[20] and even pulsars.[21]
        </p>
        <p>
          Stellar engines are hypothetical megastructures whose purpose is to extract useful energy from a star,
          sometimes for specific purposes. For example, Matrioshka brains have been proposed to extract energy for
          computation, while Shkadov thrusters would extract energy for propulsion. Some proposed stellar engine designs
          are based on the Dyson sphere.[22][23]

          Fictional accounts
        </h2>
        <p>
          A precursor to the concept of Dyson spheres was featured in the 1937 novel Star Maker by Olaf Stapledon,[1] in
          which he described "every solar system... surrounded by a gauze of light-traps, which focused the escaping
          solar energy for intelligent use".[24]
        </p>
        <p>
          Fictional Dyson spheres are typically solid structures forming a continuous shell around the star in question,
          although Dyson himself considered that prospect to be mechanically implausible.[2][3] They are sometimes used
          as the type of plot device known as a Big Dumb Object.[25]
        </p>
        <p>
          Dyson spheres appear as a background element in many works of fiction, including the 1964 novel The Wanderer
          by Fritz Leiber where aliens enclose multiple stars in this way.[1][25][26] Dyson spheres are depicted in the
          1975–1983 book series Saga of Cuckoo by Frederik Pohl and Jack Williamson, and one functions as the setting of
          Bob Shaw's 1975 novel Orbitsville and its sequels.[2][3]
        </p>
        <p>
          Variations on the concept include a single circular band in Larry Niven's 1970 novel Ringworld,[3][27][28] a
          half sphere in the 2012 novel Bowl of Heaven by Gregory Benford and Niven,[2][3] and nested spheres—also known
          as a Matrioshka brain—in Colin Kapp's 1980s Cageworld series and Brian Stableford's 1979–1990 Asgard
          trilogy.[1][3]
